# Carbon Repay

Carbon Repay is a single-page website that helps companies track their transportation-related carbon emissions and offset them through donations. It provides a user-friendly interface to monitor distance traveled, calculate emissions, and determine the corresponding donation amounts.

## Features

- **Company Information**: Keep track of the company's carbon limit and choose from three size options: Small, Medium, and Large.
- **Data Monitoring**: View real-time data on distance traveled, emissions in metric tons, and money to be donated.
- **Add Distance**: Record the distance traveled for different types of vehicles (Truck, Van, or Trailer) and automatically calculate emissions and donation amounts.
- **Emissions Calculation**: Compare the distance traveled with the carbon limit and calculate emissions based on the excess distance.
- **Donation Impact**: Understand the environmental impact by seeing the emissions converted into metric tons and the corresponding money value for donation.
